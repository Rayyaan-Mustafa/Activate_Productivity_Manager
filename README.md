##### What app do you plan to work on? 
We plan to create an app that will make time management a far easier task for everyone by allowing users to log what they do with their time and providing analytics to them on how they've been spending their time.

##### Why is it important and interesting?
As college students, we find ourselves always at a strain for time. Being able to manage our time better is something many of us focus on daily. Using the app, users will be able to better understand their habits and figure out how they can use their time better.
